# 1. Use the "each" method of Array to iterate over [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], and print out each value.

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
numbers.each {|num| puts num}

# I put curly braces because of the convention where my code is on a singlr line not multi-line. If  it were multi-line then I would use "do" and "end."
